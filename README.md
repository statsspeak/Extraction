# Extraction
This Python script performs a data pipeline that extracts data from a MySQL database, processes it in batches using pandas, and uploads the resulting CSV files to Amazon S3.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the script:

1.Import necessary libraries:
  mysql.connector to connect to the MySQL database
  pandas to process the data in batches
  boto3 to upload the resulting CSV files to Amazon S3
  StringIO to write the CSV data to memory
  os to read AWS access keys from environment variables
  logging to log information about the execution
  configparser to read configuration information from a file
  datetime to create timestamps for the CSV filenames and log entries.

2.Configure logging: A logging.basicConfig() function is called to configure logging. A file named data_pipeline.log is created, and all log messages of level INFO and higher are written to the file. The log entries include a timestamp and a message.

3.Read configuration file: A configparser.ConfigParser() object is created to read configuration information from a file named config.ini. The file contains sections for database and S3 configuration, which include host, user, password, database, bucket name, and key prefix.

4.Read database configuration from config file: config.get() function is used to retrieve the host, user, password, and database from the DATABASE section of the config.ini file.

5.Read S3 configuration from config file: config.get() function is used to retrieve the bucket name and key prefix from the S3 section of the config.ini file.

6.Read AWS access keys from environment variables: The os.environ.get() function is used to retrieve the AWS access key ID and secret access key from environment variables named AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, respectively.

7.Set batch size: A variable named batch_size is set to 100000.

8.Define the main function: The main function contains the following steps:

  Connect to the MySQL database using the mysql.connector.connect() function, passing in the host, user, password, and database information retrieved from the config file.
  Process the data in batches using a for loop that calls pd.read_sql() function to read data from the transactions table in the MySQL database in batches of batch_size rows. Each batch is processed as a pandas DataFrame object.
  Write the batch data to memory as CSV using the StringIO() function and the df.to_csv() method.
  Upload the resulting CSV files to Amazon S3 using the boto3.resource().Object().put() function. The S3 bucket name and key prefix are retrieved from the config file, and the CSV filename includes a timestamp created using datetime.now().strftime().
  Log an INFO message to the data_pipeline.log file to indicate successful execution, including a timestamp created using datetime.now().strftime().
9.Call the main function: The if __name__ == '__main__': statement is used to ensure that the main function is only called if the script is run as the main program, rather than being imported as a module. The main function is called using main().
